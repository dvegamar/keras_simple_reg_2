# keras_simple_reg_2
streamlit app with a keras model for linear multivariate regression where you can select model params.   

This second approach includes how to split the initial dataset and get accuracy measures.  

You can play and understand
how learning rate, loss functions, optimizers and activation functions work in a simple linear model made with 3 independent variables.
The app is working at streamlit servers:
